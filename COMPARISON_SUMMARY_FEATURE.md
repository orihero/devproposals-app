# Comparison Summary Feature

## Overview

The Comparison Summary feature allows users to generate comprehensive analysis reports comparing multiple vendor proposals against a project's Statement of Work (SOW) or Product Requirements Document (PRD). This feature uses AI to analyze all proposals and create detailed comparison reports.

## Features

### 1. AI-Powered Analysis
- Analyzes all proposals for a project simultaneously
- Compares proposals against the project's SOW/PRD document
- Generates detailed comparison tables and analysis
- Provides risk assessments and recommendations

### 2. Comprehensive Comparison Framework
The analysis includes:

- **Document Header**: Professional summary with project details
- **Feature/Requirement Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of how each proposal addresses requirements
- **Technical Capabilities Analysis**: Technology stack, architecture, integration capabilities
- **Commercial Terms Comparison**: Pricing models, costs, payment terms
- **Project Execution Comparison**: Timeline, team structure, project management
- **Alignment Assessment**: How well proposals meet business objectives
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical, commercial, delivery, and quality risks
- **Final Recommendation**: Clear recommendation with supporting evidence

### 3. User Interface
- **Generate Summary Button**: Appears when a project has 2+ proposals
- **Loading States**: Shows progress during AI analysis
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors with retry options
- **Download Feature**: Export summary as text file
- **Regenerate Option**: Create new analysis with updated data

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
1. Create a project with an uploaded SOW/PRD document
2. Upload at least 2 proposals for the project
3. Ensure proposals have been analyzed by the AI system

### Steps
1. Navigate to the project detail page
2. Look for the "Generate Summary" button (green button next to "Create Proposal")
3. Click the button to start the analysis
4. Wait for the AI to process all proposals (may take several minutes)
5. Review the generated comparison summary
6. Use the "Download Summary" button to save the report
7. Use "Regenerate Summary" to create a new analysis if needed

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- **Route**: `POST /api/proposals/project/:projectId/summary`
- **Service**: `openRouterService.generateComparisonSummary()`
- **File Processing**: Uses `FileReader` to extract text from uploaded documents
- **AI Analysis**: Uses OpenRouter API with Claude Sonnet 4 model

### Frontend
- **Service**: `proposalService.generateComparisonSummary()`
- **Component**: Integrated into `ProjectDetailPage.tsx`
- **State Management**: Handles loading, error, and success states
- **UI**: Responsive design with proper loading indicators

## AI Prompt Structure

The system uses a comprehensive prompt that includes:

1. **Project Information**: Title, budget, duration, status
2. **SOW/PRD Content**: Full document text for requirement analysis
3. **Proposal Content**: All proposal documents with metadata
4. **Analysis Framework**: Detailed instructions for comparison structure
5. **Output Requirements**: Formatting and quality guidelines

## Error Handling

- **File Reading Errors**: Graceful handling when documents can't be read
- **AI Service Errors**: Clear error messages with retry options
- **Network Issues**: Proper timeout handling (5 minutes for analysis)
- **Validation**: Ensures minimum requirements (2+ proposals) are met

## Performance Considerations

- **Timeout**: 5-minute timeout for comprehensive analysis
- **File Size**: Handles large documents through text extraction
- **Memory**: Efficient processing of multiple documents
- **Caching**: No caching implemented (regenerates on each request)

## Future Enhancements

- **Template Customization**: Allow users to customize analysis frameworks
- **Historical Comparisons**: Track changes in proposals over time
- **Export Formats**: Support for PDF, Word, and Excel exports
- **Collaboration**: Share summaries with team members
- **Analytics**: Track summary generation and usage metrics
